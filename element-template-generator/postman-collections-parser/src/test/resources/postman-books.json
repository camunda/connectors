			"description": "This first folder will familiarize you with the basics of APIs and how to navigate them in Postman. Before diving into the specifics of sending a request, let's make sure we're on the same page vocabulary wise.\n\nAn **Application Programming Interface**, better known as an **API**, is something that sends information back and forth between a website/app and a user. \n\nAn API Endpoint is a specific subset of functions within the same API.\n\nFor this folder, we will send a series of requests to a basic API that was built specifically for learning. It is an API that simulates a library database. You can get the books in the library, add a book, update info for a book, and delete a book. You can find find documentation for the Library API [here](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-classroom-program/documentation/15567703-da68bf1c-1aae-4f14-a79b-95926a816366). We will also get familiar with the Postman UI and understand where to look for information about the responses.\n\n### Sending requests\nThere are three parts that make up an API Request:\n1. **Method** - This is the HTTP verb that tells the API what kind of action the user is trying to make. We will cover the most common methods: GET, POST, PUT, & DELETE.\n1. **Address** - This is the base url you enter to make a request to an API.For example: `https://postman-library-api.glitch.me`\n1. **Path** - This is where you specify the specific endpoint of an API that you want to access. For example, given the previously mentioned base url of `https://postman-library-api.glitch.me`, the \"path\" would be adding `/books` to the end of it. And the entire request would be sent to `https://postman-library-api.glitch.me/books`.\n\nHere's a screenshot of how this is broken down in Postman.\n<p>\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9841162/122486387-d53fd200-cf8d-11eb-9170-ade88da39f80.png\">\n</p>\n\n\n### Inspecting a response\nThe Postman response viewer helps ensure the correctness of API responses, as well as providing valuable insight. An API response consists of the body, headers, and the status code. The status code and the completion time of the API call is visible next to the tabs.\n\nMore information on receiving responses can be found [in our documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/responses/)"

			"description": "Variables allow you to store and reuse values in your requests and scripts. By storing a value in a variable, you can reference it throughout your collections, environments, and requests—and if you need to update the value, you only have to change it in one place. Using variables increases your ability to work efficiently and minimizes the likelihood of error.\n\nIn this example, we'll set the base url for the Library API as a variable, as well as capture information from a response and set it as a variable to use in a future request.\n\nFor more information on using variables, [visit the documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/)"
