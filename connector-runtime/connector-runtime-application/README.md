# Camunda Connector Runtime

This repository the Docker image for Camunda 8 Connector Runtime.

Additionally, it provides an example of bundling a custom set of Connectors with Connector Runtime.
See [example](example) for details.

The image starts the Connector Runtime with all `jar` files provided in the `/opt/app` directory as classpath.

To use the image, add at least one Connector to the classpath. We recommend providing JARs with all dependencies bundled.

> :warning: As all Connectors share a single classpath, it can happen that
> different versions of the same dependency are available which can lead to
> conflicts. To prevent this, common dependencies like `jackson` can be shaded and
> relocated inside the connector jar.
>
> An example of such relocation with`maven-shade-plugin` can be found in the
> [Camunda 8 out-of-the-box Connectors repository](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/blob/cb925c1c5bdab9f55b77d2378be32116dec6f010/connectors/pom.xml#L83).

Example adding a Connector JAR by extending the image

```dockerfile
FROM camunda/connectors:0.20.0

ADD https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/camunda/connector/connector-http-json/0.17.0/connector-http-json-0.15.0-with-dependencies.jar /opt/app/
```

Example adding a Connector JAR by using volumes

```bash
docker run --rm --name=connectors -d \
            -v $PWD/connector.jar:/opt/app/connector.jar \                      # Add a connector jar to the classpath
            --network=your-zeebe-network \                                      # Optional: attach to network if Zeebe is isolated with Docker network
            -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_BROKER_GATEWAY-ADDRESS=ip.address.of.zeebe:26500 \  # Specify Zeebe address
            -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECURITY_PLAINTEXT=true \                           # Optional: provide security configs to connect to Zeebe
            camunda/connectors:0.20.0
```

# Secrets

To inject secrets into the Connector Runtime, they have to be available in the environment of the Docker container.

For example, you can inject secrets when running a container:

```bash
docker run --rm --name=connectors -d \
           -v $PWD/connector.jar:/opt/app/connector.jar \                      # Add a connector jar to the classpath
           --network=your-zeebe-network \                                      # Optional: attach to network if Zeebe is isolated with Docker network
           -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_BROKER_GATEWAY-ADDRESS=ip.address.of.zeebe:26500 \  # Specify Zeebe address
           -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECURITY_PLAINTEXT=true \                           # Optional: provide security configs to connect to Zeebe
           -e MY_SECRET=secret \                                               # Optional: set a secret with value
           -e SECRET_FROM_SHELL \                                              # Optional: set a secret from the environment
           --env-file secrets.txt \                                            # Optional: set secrets from a file
           camunda/connectors:0.20.0
```

The secret `MY_SECRET` value is specified directly in the `docker run` call,
whereas the `SECRET_FROM_SHELL` is injected based on the value in the
current shell environment when `docker run` is executed. The `--env-file`
option allows using a single file with the format `NAME=VALUE` per line
to inject multiple secrets at once.

# Connectors Bundle

The [Connectors Bundle project](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle) contains all available out-of-the-box Connectors provided by Camunda 8.

# Configuring additional JVM options

In case you need to fine tune your JVM, the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` is at your service. Just pass it through docker `-e` flag when running `docker run ...`.

# Using self-signed certificates

Precondition: to use self-signed certificates, you need to prepare a valid JKS [Trust Store](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/index.html).

You would need then to copy it into container using [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/), also specify container path to the trust store with `JAVAX_NET_SSL_TRUSTSTORE` environment variable, and trust store password with `JAVAX_NET_SSL_TRUSTSTOREPASSWORD` environment variable.

Example:

```bash
docker run --rm --name=connectors -d \
           -v $PWD/connector.jar:/opt/app/connector.jar \
           -v $PWD/your_truststore_file:/opt/security/truststore/your_truststore_file \  # Mount your trust store with self-signed certificates
           --network=your-zeebe-network \                                                # Optional: attach to network if Zeebe is isolated with Docker network
           -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_BROKER_GATEWAY-ADDRESS=ip.address.of.zeebe:26500 \            # Specify Zeebe address
           -e ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECURITY_PLAINTEXT=true \                                     # Optional: provide security configs to connect to Zeebe
           -e JAVAX_NET_SSL_TRUSTSTORE=/opt/security/truststore/your_truststore_file \   # Change your trust store file name
           -e JAVAX_NET_SSL_TRUSTSTOREPASSWORD=your_truststore_password \                # Provide your trust store password
           camunda/connectors:0.20.0
```
